# YouTube Data Capture

## Overview
YouTube Data Capture is a Python-based software tool designed to capture and organize information from YouTube videos and channels using the YouTube Data API. This tool can extract channel and video details, gather comments, retrieve thumbnail images, and generate CSV files and a PDF report containing all the retrieved information.

Additionally, this software can be used to close any ads or ad pop-ups on YouTube videos to ensure a clean screenshot, making it especially useful for data analysis and presentations.

## Key Features
- **Channel Information Retrieval**: Fetch details like channel title, description, published date, subscriber count, view count, and more.
- **Video Information Retrieval**: Extract video-specific information, including title, description, view count, like/dislike counts, and comment count.
- **Comments Extraction**: Capture the top-level comments for the specified video, including author, text, like count, and timestamp.
- **Thumbnail Image Capture**: Download the high-resolution thumbnail of the video.
- **PDF Report Generation**: Create a PDF report containing channel and video summaries, embedded thumbnails, and formatted comments.
- **CSV Data Export**: Output the extracted data to CSV files for further analysis.
- **Ad Removal for Screenshot Capture**: Close ads or pop-ups before capturing screenshots of videos to ensure a clean view.
