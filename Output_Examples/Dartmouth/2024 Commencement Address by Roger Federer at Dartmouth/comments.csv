@OwnedByMoomin,"I always say to talented people in sports (talented, as in they  prooved themeselves in some competition or in a team as doing something that stands out). Please respect your talent! With the explanation that they need to nurture their talent and work hard to really become someone that will be recogniezed within their sport. Whatever will be the outcome you know that you did your best and that you will carry with you all life. I didn¬¥t really respect my own talent. I found several reasons for not pushing through. Winning and knowing exactly what I needed to actually do to move to the next step i couldn¬¥t follow through. My biggest talent was grit, until it wasn¬¥t any more. I had a hard time accepting and figuring out how it was I came to a situation where I did not want it as much as before. How injuries and other stuff ended up taking my grit away instead of growing stronger. Still puzzled but I learnt over the passed 25 years that the environment didn¬¥t suit me. Individual sport but travelling with a team that casused rivalry within the team. I actually made more friends outside my own team over the years with whom I could share meaningful discussions and views of culture and life. (ok it wasn¬¥t all that deep but deep enough and much more rewarding than fighting within my own team and not having especially interesting conversations over days and months in training and competition all over the world). Not being given the space to cheerish moments of culture and history while travelling the world doing sports, is really missed opportunities. Unfortunately the time after sports has been a roller coaster of me trying to be the best I can but also not respecting the time and strategy it takes to reach goals in civilian life. I had success if it¬¥s measured in well paid and otherwise rewarding job positions, but only to feel I did not really earn it and never really finding myself. Always having that lost sporting career at the back of my mind. Finally at 45 I can truly enjoy life, family, work and everything else that is presented to me in everyday life. Maybe what Federer misses is that not everyone will have back up from family, maybe even worse, only pressure. To manage pressure from family and juggling an idea of making career choices that are not really accepted by family can be draining. To the point that you become half of what you really are and actually can achieve. So be prepared to walk that walk of not fulfilling what is expected from you but the walk that leads you to the experiences you will bring along for the rest of your life. Lost experiences is often something you will not be able to take back later in life. Be sure act on your curiosity. It doesn¬¥t cost you anything more than time and perhaps some money. Follow through and act on the things that interests you, even if they might interfere with that straight path you are expected to follow. It all adds up to something good and it adds to your character whatever the outcome of the experience will be. It could be a bad experience but it all adds up to make you a broad minded person with great understanding of many things rather than holding tight to the comfort of being great at your profession. Nothing bad with being good at your profession but the world and companies need people that are more than their profession and more than their specifik knowledge. More importantly YOU need it for yourself, for your life to be meaningful and for you to be fulfilled. The end:)",0,2024-07-18T13:32:43Z

@RogerPalacios-n4t,"My best friend from my childhood, Yayo, passed away 2 days ago at the young age of 61.  He was an athlete. Judo. Karate. Boxing. Swimming. And Tennis. I was only drawn to running long distance and boxing. I&#39;m right handed. Yayo was left handed. So after getting punched plenty on the face with his right jab, he suggested I switch to a left hand stance. I did. Took a while to get used to it but I did it. It worked great. It became second nature.  When we were about 12 Yayo invited me to play tennis with him. Never held a tennis racket before. He was very patient with me and was I think more eager than I to teach me how play tennis so I could also enjoy something he enjoyed a lot.  Regretfully, my family had to move to another city and would only see him on holidays. We remained best of friends until his passing. Even though I did not continue with tennis, I loved watching a great match. I still do. When Federer came into the scene I inmediately was drawn to him.  The way he played was absolutely marvelous. But what drew me more to him was his demeanor. Even if some people who know him personally would argue that it is all a farse, an act, I want to believe that it is not so. The guy acts so humbly in defeat but most importantly in victory. That&#39;s how my best friend Yayo was. Everytime I sit in front of the tv and watch a tennis match I think about Yayo. Every time I hear Federer speak I&#39;m reminded of Yayo&#39;s humility and generosity. Rest in peace my dear friend.",39,2024-06-29T17:47:21Z

Das zeichnet einen wahrhaft gro√üen Menschen aus. <br><br>Lieber Roger, du bezeichnest dich nicht als gro√üen Redner. Dem m√∂chte ich ein wenig widersprechen. Es war nicht nur eine unfassbar bewegende Rede, sondern du hattest sehr, sehr viel zu sagen. Zu geben. Weiterzugeben. Ein gro√üer Moment.<br>Ich bitte dich, gib deine Erfahrungen in einer Weise √§hnlich dieser auch in Deutschland oder eben deutschsprachig weiter.

@juanguillermogonzalez2764,"Here‚Äôs the summary, but please do yourself a favor and watch the whole video!<br><br>1.	Effortless is a Myth: Discipline is a talent. Trusting yourself, having patience, embracing the process, loving the process, managing your life, and managing yourself are also talents. I believe in myself, but self-belief must be earned.<br>2.	It‚Äôs Only a Point: Even professional tennis players win barely more than 50% of their points. You must learn not to dwell on every fault. Play every point as if it‚Äôs the most important, but once it‚Äôs over, let it go. The sign of a champion is not just winning repeatedly but knowing how to handle setbacks.<br>3.	Life is Bigger than the Court: Tennis can show you the world, but it cannot be your whole world. Always strive to be a great person. Leaving a familiar world behind and finding new ones is incredibly exciting and deeply rewarding.<br><br>Final Lesson: Use an eastern grip and play a one-handed backhand (This one I am mastering).",2,2024-06-15T03:48:52Z

@wallaceyallup4036,"Attacking your opponent&#39;s strength, to break them, and gain confidence. I can&#39;t believe how much Roger and I have in common, the mindset, the journey to getting to be better. I too had this mindset of attacking player&#39;s forehand (which for most, is their strength), versus attacking the backhand (which mostly is less consistent or powerful than the forehand), and it was taking what is a tougher road to finding greatness. Tougher I found because I&#39;d lose many points, games, matches because I was on a journey to becoming a more confident player, and it would happen much later on, than a few months away. Celebrating the little victories along the way, the feeling of winning just 1 or 2 more points per game even if you lost the game, is rewarding. The same goes for winning a service game, when going at their stronger side (mostly the forehand), keeping the mindset that all the while you&#39;re competing with your opponent, but at the same time, you&#39;re challenging yourself to do just a bit better with each point.  There&#39;s a lot of fail that happens along the way, and how you deal with it, and carrying forward is what defines your character on court, maybe even in life. IMHO, I feel that is how you build the confidence and mental toughness. Personally, as an athlete, that ran <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqWUuYTcG-o&amp;t=315"">5:15</a> splits in 5k and 10k races, threw 2 hitters with 19 Strike outs at 18 years old, went years without double faulting, ever., practicing strokes up against the wall for 2-3 hours per day as a college kid, serving 300 balls a day outside of tennis practice, so that I could feel confident enough to hit anywhere I wanted on the court (on my demand), only to be as relentless in life off of the court to get what I wanted,  was my resolve. Let me tell you something: any of the strengths/tools you use in life, you can be rest assured, that positive mindset happened and grew in your sport(s), one point at time, game at time, match etc..  A saying I love, anything want to learn about how to deal with everyday living, you can learn on the tennis court, playing competitive tennis.  I love this game so, so much. I gave it to my Son. I loved watching him play, grow as a person, and as a high-performing athlete in it.  In my adult years, and as I found The Maestro, The King, The GOAT, I watched his matches and replays, and enjoyed it, still do to this day, here it is 23 years later. I still play, and I still channel RF when I need to dig deep and focus.  My zone is peRFect when I know I am out there playing to be better than the shot before, the day before, match before.  It&#39;s important to keep growing, in my personal opinion. Glass is half full, always.  I love this game. I love who Roger Federer is.   What a speech he gave, right?  Oh, and, Congratulations to you 2024 Grads, and to Dr. Roger Federer, also Class of 2024.  Bravissimo!",0,2024-06-14T17:10:21Z

@krrishagarwalla3325,"1. Effortless is a myth because nobody sees you making it effortless<br>2. You need a whole arsenal of strengths - win on the days you are not your best <br>3. Gift vs grit<br>4. Managing your life is a talent<br>5. Discipline and patience is a talent<br>6. You can work harder than you can imagine<br>7. Perfection is impossible - keep iterating<br>8. When you are playing a point it is the most important thing but when it is behind it is behind prepare for the next point<br>9. Master at over coming hard moments<br>10. Lose again and again and learn to deal with it<br>11. Work smarter<br>12. Life is bigger than a court, you profession cannot be your world<br>13. Never forgot from where you have came from ; Never lose the appetite for the big world<br>14. All of you have so much to give and you will find many ways to give. <br>15.

@BDennisHughes,"Just a few observations from someone who was there (my niece received her undergraduate degree). The crowd (including the students) loved the speech. The reason the applause is muted was weather related. We were all holding umbrellas and slapping our free hand against our legs but that just isn&#39;t as loud as two hands clapping. The protesters numbered about 50 and were barely audible if you were in the crowd (at least from where I was near the Jumbotron). Nobody paid them a lick of attention that I noticed. Last and most important, it truly was a memorable speech, and like Doctor Roger, I will never forget that I was there &quot;On the Green&quot;. And if I ever do see him on the street, I will definitely thank him and congratulate him. Awesome experience for this 62 year old!",1152,2024-06-11T02:11:18Z

@shane5723,"I have said it many times, and I&#39;ll say it again, this man is not the Greatest Tennis Player Of All Time, although he is one of the top three greatest of all time, but he is without ANY doubt the most LOVED tennis player and in my opinion the most LOVED athlete of all time. There is a reason for that, and the reason is obvious when you watch this 26 minute speech. Roger Federer is the most genuine and loving sports star that anyone will ever meet or watch. His love for people including his family, friends, fans, and even these kids that he doesn&#39;t know at all shines as brightly as a star when you look in his eyes and see his expressions on his face. He is truly remarkable not only as a tennis player, but as a man as well. Thank you Roger for the 24 years (1998-2022) of tennis euphoria you gave to your fans, but thank you üò¢even more for being the man, the dad, the husband, the son, the brother, the friend, the role model, and the inspiration to more people than you could ever imagine. There are two tennis players (Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal) who have finally after so many years of trying eclipsed your records, but no amount of trying by them or any other player that has ever played or will ever play will be enough to eclipse you as a man, and what you have meant to the sport of tennis.

I love tennis when Rafa was asked to join Roger for one last match he accepted it without hesitation although he was on his way to be a father in two weeks.
